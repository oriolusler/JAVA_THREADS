You will probably notice that sometimes two (or more) consecutive PONGS
 (or PINGS) appear.  Add a “synchronization mechanism” that makes the 
interleaving of PINGS and PONGS perfect (each ping is preceded and followed 
by a pong, each pong is preceded and followed by a ping). Consider these two 
possibilities:

a.	...


b.	Both threads share an object that has an int attribute. If its value 
is 1, PING can print its line, if its value is 2, PONG can print its line.
