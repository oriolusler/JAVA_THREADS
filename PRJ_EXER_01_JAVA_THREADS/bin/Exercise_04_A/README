a)	Write a subclass of Thread the instances of which endlessly print 
(System.out.println) a String composed of a line (given as a parameter) and 
a number reflecting the times the main loop has been performed (counter).
Writer a “Launcher” program that creates two instances of the threads previously
described, starts them, waits (sleeps) for a number of seconds (e.g. 5), 
kills the threads and writes the total number of times each thread has 
performed its main loop.
