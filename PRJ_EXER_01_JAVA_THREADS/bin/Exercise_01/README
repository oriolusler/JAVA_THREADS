Write a program that runs 5 threads, each thread randomizes a number 
between 1 and 10, writes it on the screen and stores it in an attribute 
(provide a getter). The main thread waits for all the others to finish, 
calculates the sum of the numbers which were randomized and prints the sum. 
Use method join.
