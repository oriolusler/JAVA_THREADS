You will probably notice that sometimes two (or more) consecutive PONGS
 (or PINGS) appear.  Add a “synchronization mechanism” that makes the 
interleaving of PINGS and PONGS perfect (each ping is preceded and followed 
by a pong, each pong is preceded and followed by a ping). Consider these two 
possibilities:

a.	Each thread has a publicly accessible canPrint attribute the value 
of which is true if and only if the thread is allowed to print its message. 
Before printing the thread busy waits until its canPrint attribute is true. 
After printing, the thread changes its canPrint attribute to false, 
its companion’s to true and goes to sleep (Provide a setCompanion method so 
that the main thread can set each thread’s companion).
